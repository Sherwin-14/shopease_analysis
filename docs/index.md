    Welcome to the EDA Docs for Ecommerce Analysis! This documentation is divided into several sections, each providing in-depth insights into various aspects of ecommerce data analysis. In the **Categories and Items** section, we explore the major categories and items within each category, helping you understand the product landscape. The **Prices and Brands** section analyzes the major players in the market, customer preferences, and the highest-priced products in each brand, providing insights into pricing strategies and brand performance.

    The remaining sections delve deeper into specific aspects of ecommerce analysis. The **Time Distribution Analysis** section examines the times when customer interactions occur, while the **Brand Analysis Extended** section analyzes how brands perform over time using time series factors. The **Requested Items Analysis** section focuses on a specific set of items requested by stakeholders, providing detailed insights into their performance. Finally, the **Customer Segmentation Model** section presents an RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) model used to segment customers based on their behavior, enabling targeted marketing efforts and improved customer satisfaction.
