# ShopEase Ecommerce Analysis

## Overview

This project involves the analysis of e-commerce store data for Shopease to derive valuable insights and build a machine learning model for customer segmentation. The analysis focuses on understanding customer behavior and preferences through RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis.

## Web App

You can access the web application for ShopEase [here](https://shopease.streamlit.app/prices_and_brands_analysis).

## Project Description

The primary goal of this project is to analyze customer data from Shopease to identify patterns and segments within the customer base. By applying RFM analysis, we can categorize customers based on their purchasing behavior, which can help in targeted marketing and improving customer retention.

## Data Analysis

The data analysis includes the following steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Gathering data from the Shopease e-commerce platform.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Preprocessing the data to handle missing values and outliers.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing and summarizing the data to uncover trends and insights.
4. **RFM Analysis**: Calculating Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values for each customer to segment them into different categories.

## Machine Learning Model

The project includes a machine learning model for customer segmentation based on the RFM analysis. The model helps in identifying distinct customer segments, which can be used for personalized marketing strategies.

### Key Steps in Model Development:

1. **Feature Engineering**: Creating features based on RFM values.
2. **Model Selection**: Choosing appropriate algorithms for clustering (e.g., K-Means).
3. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the model using relevant metrics.
